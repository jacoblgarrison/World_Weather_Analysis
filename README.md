## Overview

Our PlanMyTrip app did so well, we were asked to make some changes to better satisfy the beta testers. Some of those changes included adding a weather description for the weather data we have already compiled. In the following code, we added some input statements so the beta testers could add their own preferences and filter the trip to their liking. Next, we had the beta testers choose a list of four cities to create their travel itinerary. From these four cities, we created a travel route between them all as well as added a marker layer to the map. This will assist anyone who uses our app with any travels they want to add to the PlanMyTrip app.
